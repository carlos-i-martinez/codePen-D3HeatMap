## Technologies Used:
> * HTML, JavaScript, CSS and D3.  

## Some requirements to complete project:
> * JSON dataset used to create chart: [Global Temp Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json)
> *  Should have x-axis and y-axis g elements and both axes should contain multiple tick labels.

>  * Should have a rect elements for each cell data point.

>  * Minimum of 4 different colors used to fill cells.
